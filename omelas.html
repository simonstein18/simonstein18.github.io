  <p>The story "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" presents a city full of happiness where anything that could potentially harm others does not exist. However, there is one condition: a child is locked up and forced to suffer so that the rest of the city can live in happiness. While many live with these rules, there are some who cannot bear to live there since the happiness of people living in the city is built upon the oppression and suffering of one individual. I agree that a society built on the foundation of sacrifice and suffering of an individual for happiness is flawed and that true happiness cannot be achieved through the oppression of others. But, I do agree that happiness cannot be achieved without some type of suffering. Suffering is an essential aspect of life and is necessary for personal growth and sometimes to truly feel happiness. But, I think there needs to be personal suffering from everyone for there to be happiness and even then it may come at different times for each person. Therefore, a society that prioritizes constant happiness is flawed, since it fails to acknowledge the importance of collective suffering as part of happiness. And the idea of a perfect society where everyone is happy is not ideal since happiness can vary among people. This poses the idea that it may be impossible to have complete happiness without everyone sacrificing or suffering individually in some way. <b>While individual sacrifice is necessary for personal happiness, true happiness cannot be achieved at the expense of others' suffering.</b>
