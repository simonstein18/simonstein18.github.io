    In this article, author Dr. Nicki Washington explains her experience of trying to get her paper peer reviewed, to ultimately get published. Unfortunately, her paper was denied after being peer reviewed and after looking at the issues, she found three biased reasons that the reviewers denied her.
First the reviewers argued that only full-time tenure faculty have the "technical depth" to discuss identity, when she herself is a Black woman who is knowledgeable about teaching students about equity and inclusion. Second, they argued that she didn't submit enough references, even though the requirements stated none were required. And third, she argued that the reviewers didn’t do enough research after they argued she spelled a citation wrong when in-fact she spelled it right.
<b>Given these points she believes that the peer review process, especially the Special Interest Group in CS Education (SIGCSE) Technical Symposium that she experienced, is biased towards those who are not white and/or have a Ph.D. </b>She further claims that they are centered on whiteness and anything related to broadening participation or diversity, equity, and inclusion won’t be accepted. She wants there to be a “Serious Conversation” about these issues and for changes to be made to address them.
