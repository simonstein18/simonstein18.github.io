  <p style="width: 80%; margin: auto; font-family: calibri;">Along with reading ‘How AI Is Improving Accessibility’, I also read the cited work called ‘Education Technologies Are Making Learning More Accessible’. <b>The two articles argue that new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Reality and Virtual Reality are creating more opportunities for the neurodivergent community. These new technologies in education and work settings are also creating more inclusive environments and offering more opportunities to jobs and education specifically for neurodivergent people.</b> In terms of winners and losers of technological advancements, technology has definitely improved the lives of many people but it has not benefited everyone equally. Previously technology may have been focused on improving the lives of the mass population, with little advancements for  the neurodivergent community. But, the new technology described in the articles is leveling the playing field by creating new opportunities for them to succeed. As new technology is created, it is essential to prioritize accessibility and ensure that everyone has equal access to its benefits.</p>
